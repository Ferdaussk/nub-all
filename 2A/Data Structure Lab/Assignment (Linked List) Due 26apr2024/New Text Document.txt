1. Write a C++ program to merge two sorted singly linked lists into a single sorted linked list.

 :Two sorted singly linked lists:
1 3 5 7
2 4 6 
 After merging the said two sorted lists:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 


2. Write a C++ program to check if a singly linked list is a palindrome or not.

 :Original Singly List:
1 2 3 4 5 
The linked list is not a palindrome. 

Original Singly List:
1 2 2 1 
The linked list is a palindrome. 

Original Singly List:
MADAM 
The linked list is a palindrome.


3. Write a C++ program to remove duplicates from a doubly unsorted linked list.

 :Original Singly List:
1 2 3 3 4 
After removing duplicate elements from the said singly list:
1 2 3 4 
Original Singly List:
1 2 3 3 4 4 
After removing duplicate elements from the said singly list:
1 2 3 4 


4. Write a C++ program to merge two sorted doubly linked lists into a single sorted linked list.

 :Two sorted singly linked lists:
1 3 5 7 
                                                     2 4 6 
After merging the said two sorted lists:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7


5. Write a C++ program that reverses a doubly linked list

 :Original List: 1 3 4 7 9
Reversed list:
9 7 4 3 1
