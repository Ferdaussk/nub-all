Subject: Clarification Request for Tasks 4 and 5

Dear Professor Zunaed Farabe,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm seeking clarification on tasks 4 and 5 in the recent assignment (Lab ass 3). I've completed tasks 1-3 but am facing challenges with the last two. Could you provide further guidance or examples to help me understand the requirements better?

Thank you for your time.

Best regards,
MD. JANNAT FERDAUS
